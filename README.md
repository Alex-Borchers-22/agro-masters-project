# Ag-AI
Masters Project

The objective of this research project is to investigate the efficacy of metamorphic relations in testing the accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) Models and the impact of hyperparameter mutation in a model post-training. The ML model utilized is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) applied to image classification tasks. Metamorphic relations are transformations applied to known test inputs which enable one to anticipate the effect on outputs. Mutation testing are operations that change the application behavior to identify efficacies of test inputs. The application being explored is an interactive image classification platform. The application has been modified to serve as an educational and exploratory tool for ML engineers and data scientists. It provides an opportunity for users to gain an understanding of metamorphic relations, their uses, and their potential impact on ML models. The application allows the user to build their own model with the selection of different metamorphic transformations and hyperparameters. The model is then trained on a set of images that the user classifies interactively. Once the model is trained, the user can generate hyperparameter mutations via a ChatGPT API, and analyze the impact that different hyperparameters changes have on the confidence and accuracy of the model.
